<p>Army Chief Lt. Gen. Hussain Muhammad Ershad on 24 March 1982 failed to block, despite temporary setbacks, the forward march of the nationalist forces of Bangladesh led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). There were continuous attempts made to cause splits within the BNP and as part of those efforts some front ranking leaders were lured into joining Ershad. Everything said and done, the party survived all conspiracies to cripple and dismantle it. It was possible because Begum Khaleda Zia, an unlikely successor to Zia the statesman, rose to the occasion. She joined the BNP, relatively quickly learnt the art of politics and political leadership, carried forward the flag of Bangladeshi Nationalism and eventually, through a circuitous path, steered the party and won the political battle.
